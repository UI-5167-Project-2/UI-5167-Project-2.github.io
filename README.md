## Documentation

The full project documentation is available as a PDF in the repository. You can view it directly in GitHub or serve it via Pages:

- PDF: `public/project2-doc.pdf`
- Link (from repo root): ./public/project2-doc.pdf

To include this documentation in the `UI-5167-Project-2.github.io` Pages site, copy `public/project2-doc.pdf` 
into the Pages repo root (or another folder) and update any links in that site's README or pages. GitHub will render PDF files when they are navigated to in the browser.
